## `ðŸ“ƒ` Introduction
Zynk is a Turing-complete, interpreted programming language written in C++. This project was created as a personal endeavor to learn and practice C++. It is not intended for extensive practical use but rather serves as a learning platform.

## `ðŸŒŸ` Features
- **Interpreted Language:** Zynk is an interpreted language, which facilitates quick development and testing cycles.
- **Touring-Complete:** Zynk is capable of expressing any computable function, adhering to the touring-complete classification.
- **C++ Backend:** Written in C++, Zynk leverages the performance and capabilities of C++ while providing a user-friendly interface.

## `ðŸ“–` Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for Zynk is available on our [**Documentation Website**](https://xxenvy.github.io/Zynk/). The documentation includes:

- **[Installation Guide](https://xxenvy.github.io/Zynk/installation/):** Detailed instructions for installing Zynk.
- **[Hello World Tutorial](https://xxenvy.github.io/Zynk/examples/hello_world/):** A step-by-step guide to writing your first Zynk program.
- **[Basic Examples](https://xxenvy.github.io/Zynk/examples/basics/):** Simple code examples to get you started.
- **[Data Types](https://xxenvy.github.io/Zynk/data-types/):** Overview of primitive data types in Zynk.

## `ðŸš€` Road to 1.0
> Keep in mind that **Zynk** is a very young project!

As Zynk progresses towards version 1.0, the following components are planned and required for the interpreter:
- [x] **Lexer:** Implementing a lexer to tokenize input source code.
- [x] **Parser:** Developing a parser to parse tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- [x] **Evaluator:** Creating an evaluator to interpret and execute code represented by the AST.
- [x] **Runtime:** Implementing a runtime environment responsible for managing execution contexts, memory allocation, and variable scope resolution during program execution.
- [x] **GC:** Implementing a Garbage Collection (GC) system to automatically manage memory, reclaim unused memory.
- [x] **Documentation:** Developing thorough documentation that covers usage instructions, language syntax and examples.
- [ ] **Turing-Complete Features:** Enhancing language features to fully meet the Turing-complete classification, ensuring that Zynk can simulate any Turing machine.
- [ ] **Visual Studio Code Plugin:** Creating a plugin for Visual Studio Code to enhance the development experience for Zynk.
