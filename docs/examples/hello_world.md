# Write your first program

Welcome to the "Hello, World!" tutorial for Zynk. In this guide, we'll create a simple Zynk program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Follow the steps below to get started.

## 1. Create a new Zynk file

First, you'll need to create a new file with a `.zk` extension. This file will contain your Zynk code.

1. Open your favorite text editor or IDE.
2. Create a new file and save it as `hello.zk`.

## 2. Write your Zynk program

In the `hello.zk` file, write the following Zynk code:

    println("Hello, World!");

### Explanation

- `println("Hello, World!");`: This line of code calls the `println` function, which outputs the string `"Hello, World!"` to the console followed by a newline character.

## 3. Run your Zynk program

To run your Zynk program, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt.**
2. **Navigate to the directory containing your `hello.zk` file. For example:**

    ```
    cd path/to/your/directory
    ```

3. **Execute the Zynk interpreter with your file as an argument:**

    ```
    ./Zynk hello.zk
    ```

### Expected Output

When you run the program, you should see the following output:

    Hello, World!

## 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure of the following:

- The Zynk interpreter is correctly installed and located in your system's PATH.
- The file extension is `.zk` and the code is properly written.
- You are running the command from the directory where `hello.zk` is located.

## Next Steps

Congratulations on writing your first Zynk program! Here are some suggestions for what to do next:

- Explore more Zynk functions and syntax by referring to the [Language Reference](#) section of the documentation.
- Experiment with more complex programs and learn about variables, loops, and functions in Zynk.

Happy coding!
