# Data types

Zynk currently supports only primitive data types, which are fundamental for basic computations and operations.

## Primitive Data Types

Zynk offers several primitive data types:

- **Integer (`int`)**: Represents whole numbers without decimals.
- **Float (`float`)**: Represents numbers with decimals.
- **Bool (`bool`)**: Represents truth values, true or false (1 and 0).
- **String (`string`)**: Represents sequences of characters.
- **Null (`null`)**: Represents null value.
