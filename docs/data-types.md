# Data types

Zynk currently supports only primitive data types, which are fundamental for basic computations and operations. Understanding these types is essential for writing efficient and correct programs. This section will cover the basic data types available in Zynk.

## Primitive Data Types

Zynk offers several primitive data types:

- **Integer (`int`)**: Represents whole numbers without decimals.
- **Float (`float`)**: Represents numbers with decimals.
- **Bool (`bool`)**: Represents truth values, true or false (1 and 0).
- **String (`string`)**: Represents sequences of characters.
- **Null (`null`)**: Represents null value.
